# Simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) in Python using only numpy

This is a simple implementation of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) in Python using only numpy as a dependency.

The implementation was inspired on this [***project***](https://www.kaggle.com/code/wwsalmon/simple-mnist-nn-from-scratch-numpy-no-tf-keras).

This was a personal project of mine to better understand how neural networks work.

# Requirements

This project was tested on Python 3.11.7.

To install the dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage

Everything is documented in the [***notebook***](notebook.ipynb).

In order to run it you need to download this [***dataset***](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv).
